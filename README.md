Inside this repo you have currently:

->"My First Game"
A very basic "Cacth-the-ball" minigame where you can use the arrow keys to move the ball into the chest, done only to mess around with Unity.

.\Test and Exercises
-> PR1 Scripting
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!important

1.Here you have two versions of the same Practice, the first one is broken beyond repair as I tried to write code without looking anything up, only posted here as a testimony of how far could I go before failing.

2.The second Version is the one to Submit, it's done following the guide provided here https://www.raywenderlich.com/4180875-introduction-to-unity-scripting-part-1#toc-anchor-008 and currently it's all functioning exept the part where you change the HayMachine's Color.

Thats All,
Ferran Enguix
